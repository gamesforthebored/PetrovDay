Take an \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{eighth candle} and insert it into a

dripping wax. Have a \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{printed copy of this booklet} ready.

Fill in the blank on page 3 beforehand with the number of years since 1983.

The ceremony should begin after dark. Start with the lights on or dimmed, but
turn them off once the first candle is lit.

Welcome to the Petrov Day ceremony. Here's how it works:

\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item We will pass around the booklet, taking turns reading from it by
	candlelight.
	\item Read regular text aloud; perform italicized actions.
	\item Speak loudly and clearly; don't fret over pronunciation.
	\item Read attributions for quotes.
	\item At the triangle symbol (▲), come up to the table and perform the
	action.
	\item At horizontal lines, pass the booklet and candle.
	\item Silence your phones.
\end{itemize}

Are there any questions?\stagedir{Pause for questions}

An alarm at the command and control post went off with red letters blinking on
the terminal. It was a nasty shock. Everyone jumped from their seats, looking at
me. What could I do? There was an operations procedure that I had written
myself. We did what we had to do. We checked the operation of all systems---on

probability factor is two. ... The highest.}{Stanislav Petrov\footnote{Васильев,

Instead of telling his superiors what the system was saying, Petrov told his
superiors that it was a false alarm---despite not really knowing this was the
case.

At the time, he received no award. The incident embarrassed his superiors and
the scientists responsible for the system, so if he had been rewarded, they
would have had to be punished. (He received the International Peace Prize
thirty years later, in 2013).

on most bombs, to prevent the risk of accidental (or deliberate but
unauthorized) detonation.
