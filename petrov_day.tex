Version short-version (2023-09-08)

Original ceremony by James Babcock with content contributions by Ben
Landau-Taylor, Adia Porter, Daniel Speyer and Raymond Arnold, and quotations
from many sources. Modifications by the Austin LessWrong Ritual Working Group.

Thanks to Eliezer Yudkowsky for introducing the idea of commemorating Petrov
Day, and to all the testers, event organizers, and others who've made this
possible.

Set up a \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{table} in the middle of the room and gather everyone around.

Place on the table:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item a \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{candelabrum} with eight holders,
	\item \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{seven unlit candles} in a
	\myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{tray} (but not in the candelabrum), and
	\item a \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{lighter or matches} (and if the latter,
	\myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{a cup of sand or water} in which to douse them).
\end{itemize}

Take an \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{eighth candle} and insert it into a
\myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{candle-holder} so that it can be moved around without
dripping wax. Have a \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{printed copy}
\myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{of this booklet} ready.

The ceremony should begin after dark. Start with the lights on or dimmed, but
turn them off once the first candle is lit.

to be read aloud. Whenever there is a horizontal line, it becomes the next

\stagedir{The speech should be given extemporaneously, but make sure to cover
all the bullet points.}

Welcome to the Petrov Day ceremony. Here's how it works:

\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item We will pass around this booklet, and take turns reading from it by
	candlelight.
	\item When it comes to you, read aloud the text in bold and do the actions
	described in brackets.
	\item Speak loudly and clearly, so everyone can hear you. Don’t worry about
	hard-to-pronounce words; just power through them.
	\item If you see a triangle symbol (\dag), come up to the table and
	perform the action.
	\item When you come to a horizontal line (---), pass the booklet and candle
	to the next person.
	\item Please silence your phones.
\end{itemize}

Are there any questions?\stagedir{Pause for questions}

Let us begin.

On September 26, 1983, Stanislav Petrov was the duty officer at the Oko
nuclear early warning system.

\blockquote{% Сирена на КП вовсю ревет, красные буквы полыхают. Шок, конечно,
% колоссальный. [...] Все повскакивали из-за пультов, на меня смотрят. А я что?
% Все по инструкции для оперативных дежурных, которую сам и написал. Сделали

% проверки, один за другим. Идут доклады: все совпадает, вероятность - двойка.
% [...] Это высшая[.]
An alarm at the command and control post went off with red letters blinking on
the terminal. It was a nasty shock. Everyone jumped from their seats, looking
at me. What could I do? There was an operations procedure that I had written
myself. We did what we had to do. We checked the operation of all systems—on
30 levels, one after another. Reports kept coming in: All is correct; the
probability factor is two. ... The highest.}{Stanislav Petrov}

}

\page{

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{images/StanislavPetrov.jpg}
\end{center}

The procedure was clear: report up the chain of command that the Americans had
launched missiles. This could have set off a nuclear war.

If the launch was real, failing to report it promptly could mean losing a
nuclear war.

What would you have done?

\divider

\blockquote{I imagined if I’d assume the responsibility for unleashing the
third World War—and I said, no, I wouldn’t. ... I always thought of it.
Whenever I came on duty, I always refreshed it in my memory.}{Stanislav Petrov}

}

\page{

Instead of telling his superiors what the system was saying, Petrov told his
superiors that it was a false alarm—despite not really knowing this was the
case.

\divider

At the time, he received no award. The incident embarrassed his superiors and
the scientists responsible for the system, so if he had been rewarded, they
would have had to be punished. (He received the International Peace Prize
thirty years later, in 2013).

\divider

Things eventually calmed down. The Soviet Union dissolved. Safeguards were put
on most bombs, to prevent the risk of accidental (or deliberate but
unauthorized) detonation.

But not every threat to humanity is as easy to understand as nuclear weapons.

\blockquote{The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made

timescale than you do; by the time your neurons finish thinking the words ``I
