Set up a \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{table} in the middle of the room and gather everyone around.

Place on the table:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item a \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{candelabrum} with eight holders,
	\item \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{seven unlit candles} in a
	\myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{tray} (but not in the candelabrum), and
	\item a \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{lighter or matches} (and if the latter,
	\myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{a cup of sand or water} in which to douse them).
\end{itemize}

Take an \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{eighth candle} and insert it into a
\myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{candle-holder} so that it can be moved around without
dripping wax. Have a \myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{printed copy}
\myul{2pt}{0.5pt}{1pt}{of this booklet} ready.

The ceremony should begin after dark. Start with the lights on or dimmed, but
turn them off once the first candle is lit.

launched missiles. This could have set off a nuclear war.

If the launch was real, failing to report it promptly could mean losing a
nuclear war.

Instead of telling his superiors what the system was saying, Petrov told his
superiors that it was a false alarm—despite not really knowing this was the
case.

\divider

At the time, he received no award. The incident embarrassed his superiors and
the scientists responsible for the system, so if he had been rewarded, they
would have had to be punished. (He received the International Peace Prize
thirty years later, in 2013).

Things eventually calmed down. The Soviet Union dissolved. Safeguards were put
on most bombs, to prevent the risk of accidental (or deliberate but
unauthorized) detonation.

But not every threat to humanity is as easy to understand as nuclear weapons.
