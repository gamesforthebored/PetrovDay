Petrov Day
==========

Petrov Day is a yearly event on September 26 commemorating the anniversary of
the Petrov incident, where a false alarm in the Soviet early warning system
nearly set off a nuclear war. This is a ritual designed to be performed on that
day, with text to read and symbolic actions involving candles.

This git repository contains LaTeX sources for the event handbook, which are
used to generate PDFs. To generate the PDFs this way, you will need 'make' and
'pdflatex'.
